export default `She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sittin' with you but her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see
What you think you're gettin' for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

Oh oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Oh oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man, she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

Oh oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Oh oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Oh oh, here she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh oh, here she comes, watch out
She's a maneater

Oh oh, here she comes, she's a maneater
Ooh, she'll chew you up
Oh oh, here she comes
Here she comes, she's a maneater

Oh oh, here she comes, watch out
She'll only come out at night, woo
Oh oh, here she comes
Here she comes, she's a maneater

Oh oh, here she comes, she's a maneater
The woman is wild woo
Oh oh, here she comes
Here she comes, watch out boy, watch out boy

Oh oh, here she comes
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
Oh oh, here she comes, watch out
Maneater

Oh oh, here she comes, she's a maneater
She's watching and waiting
Oh oh, here she comes
Oh, she's a maneater`
